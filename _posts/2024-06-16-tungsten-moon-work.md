Tungsten Moon Demo now includes a panel on the right side of the cockpit that gives the player access to all available spawn points. The game save/load logic has been reworked, accordingly.

The game now auto-saves any time you perform a safe landing on any surface. When the game loads, or if you crash the ship, your last auto-save is loaded automatically. The current world clock is also saved and is automatically restored.
